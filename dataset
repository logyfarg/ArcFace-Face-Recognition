This project uses face images for recognition. For full-scale training, we recommend the following datasets:

- **VGGFace2** (large, clean dataset for face recognition):

- **MS1M-ArcFace / MS1MV2**:
  [InsightFace Dataset Zoo](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/wiki/Dataset-Zoo)
- **CASIA-WebFace**:

> ⚠️ **Note:** Full datasets are too large to host on GitHub.  
> For demonstration or testing purposes, a small subset of images (2–5 per person) is included in this repository in `datasets/face_recognition/`.
